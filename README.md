# Automation
This program utilizes browser automation (Selenium) and web scraping procedures. It uses random time intervals in-between actions to appear as human activity. 
Creates a text file to keep record of the program's of activities and collected data and prints its progress with this data to the console.

Simply enter your username, password and a target account.

Variables controlling time and number of iterations can be modified.

Keep Selemium and HTML elements up to date.

Last but not least!!~ this version of the program works in the US. Per testing with a client located in Germany - other countries may have additional web pages or notifications which will require modifications to the code.
